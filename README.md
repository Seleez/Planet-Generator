# Planet-Generator
**Using unity 2021.3.21f1 version**

**Settings:**
 
   - Resolution: 10 - 255 (If you want to view the planet on higher resolution i advise to only show one of the face)
   - Planet radius: 1+
   - **Noise layers**:
     -  Simple noise: 
        -  Use first noise layer as mask: For the first layer it should be off. For other layers if its on it will reduce the efect of this layer.
        -  Octaves: 4+ (Each subsequent octave has a smaller impact on the final result)
        -  Strenght: 0.2 +
        -  Base roughness: 0.2+ (it effect how terrein will be separatet from each other. If the number is to large the terrain will be split in to little islands)
        -  Roughness: 1+ (it controls how sharp are the edges beetwean the parts of terrain)
